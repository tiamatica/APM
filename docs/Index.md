# APM

APM defines the concept of an APL [Project](./Project.md), ie. how to organise code in a way that allows for easier:

* application development
* distribution of code modules
* distribution of user commands

APM consists of three main modules:

1. [Client](./Client.md)
1. [Server](./Server.md)
1. [Registry](./Registry.md)

The three modules interact with each other via clearly defined APIs so as to separate their roles and make it easier to extend in the future. Each module is described in further detail on their own pages.
